# Cybersecurity Core Concepts – Key Terms and Principles

## CIA Triad

The CIA Triad is fundamental in cybersecurity. It consists of:

- **Confidentiality**
  - Keeping sensitive information secret.
  - Techniques: encryption, access control.
  - Example: Preventing third-party access to private data.

- **Integrity**
  - Ensuring data is accurate and unaltered.
  - Protects against unauthorized or accidental changes.
  - Techniques: checksums, hashes.

- **Availability**
  - Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed.
  - Techniques: redundancy, backups, failover systems.

Every cybersecurity incident usually involves a failure in one or more of these three areas.

## AAA: Identification, Authentication, Authorization, Accounting

- **Identification**
  - Stating your identity (e.g., username).

- **Authentication**
  - Proving your identity.
  - Techniques: passwords, PINs, multi-factor authentication (MFA).

- **Authorization**
  - Granting access to resources based on verified identity.
  - Example: access to files, systems.

- **Accounting**
  - Tracking and logging user actions.
  - Example: auditing login attempts, system usage.

## Three States of Data

1. **Data in Transit**
   - Data moving over a network.
   - Protection: encryption (e.g., TLS).

2. **Data at Rest**
   - Data stored on devices or servers.
   - Protection: encryption, physical security.

3. **Data in Use**
   - Data actively being processed or accessed.
   - Example: live data during Formula E racing being sniffed by competitors.
   - Protection: real-time encryption, secure hardware.

## Non-Repudiation

- Ensures that the sender of information cannot deny sending it.
- Techniques: digital signatures, certificates.
- Real-world example: Sending a signed digital contract.

---

## Gap Analysis

- Evaluates differences between current security posture and desired security standards.
- Questions asked:
  - What are we doing?
  - What should we be doing?
  - Where are the gaps?

---

## Vulnerabilities, Threats, and Risks

- **Vulnerability**
  - A weakness in a system or process.
  - Example: dependency on electricity.

- **Threat**
  - A potential exploitation of a vulnerability.
  - Can be man-made or natural.

- **Risk**
  - The probability and impact of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.
  - Risk = Likelihood × Impact.

---

## Data Sovereignty

- Data is subject to the laws of the country of the individual it refers to.
- Example: GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) in the EU.
- Data about EU citizens is protected even if processed outside the EU.

---

## Notes

- These terms form the foundation of cybersecurity discussions and strategies.
- Keep them in mind while analyzing incidents, writing policies, or designing systems.
